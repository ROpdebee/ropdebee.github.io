In this session, we’ll review the essential tools for managing development dependencies (e.g., Maven, npm), deployment dependencies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), and infrastructure configurations (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) in the software supply chain—and highlight the unique security challenges that come with each. We’ll present the latest research into these security challenges, and demystify the inner workings of the newest tools designed to tackle them.

Join this session to hear about cutting-edge solutions in security testing and software composition analysis, and to gain practical knowledge to better secure your development pipeline.
