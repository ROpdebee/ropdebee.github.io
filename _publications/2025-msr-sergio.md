End-to-end (E2E) testing is a software validation approach that simulates realistic user scenarios throughout the entire workflow of an application. In the context of web applications, E2E testing involves two activities: Graphic User Interface (GUI) testing, which simulates user interactions with the web appâ€™s GUI through web browsers, and performance testing, which evaluates system workload handling. Despite its recognized importance in delivering high-quality web applications, the availability of large-scale datasets featuring real-worldE2E web tests remains limited, hindering research in the field. To address this gap, we present E2EGit, a comprehensive dataset of non-trivial open-source web projects collected on GITHUB that adopt E2E testing. By analyzing over 5,000web repositories across popular programming languages (JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, TYPESCRIPT and PYTHON), we identified 472repositories implementing 43,670 automated Web GUI tests with popular browser automation frameworks (SELENIUM, PLAY-WRIGHT, CYPRESS, PUPPETEER), and 84 repositories that featured 271 automated performance tests implemented leveraging the most popular open-source tools (JMETER, LOCUST). Among these, 13 repositories implemented both types of testing for a total of 786 Web GUI tests and 61 performance tests.
